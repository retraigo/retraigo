# Postulates of NeTT
- If you have an opinion, share it or suggest it. Don't force it on others.
- If you have a personal belief, be it religious or ethical, don't force it on others.
- If you have a personal problem with someone, take it to where it belongs. Bringing it to unrelated online platforms wouldn't give you justice.
- If you need help with something, describe what you need help with instead of asking if you can get help without describing the matter.
- If you are asking for help, be clear with what you exactly need. You might end up wasting the time of the person trying to help you as well as that of yourself.
- If someone asks for help and you don't want to help them, just don't help them. Instead, don't blame their ignorance on the matter.
- If someone doesn't like something, don't do it just to piss them off.
- If someone starts complaining about everything for no reason, just don't mind them. There is no cure for stupidity.
- If you have a sense of justice, it makes sense that the other person would have their own. Your justice is not their justice.
- If you are feeling uncomfortable with something, speak up. However, do not assume that every other person would feel the same.
